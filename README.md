# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 
Neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python is implemented in this project. Neural network is a subset of Machine Learning specialized in solving solving artificial intelligence problems.

## Results 
* The target for the model: "is_successful" variable.
* Features for the model: "Application_type","Affiliation","Classification","Use_Case","organization","Status","Income_Amt","special_Considerations""
* Two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons were applied despite using Relu, and Sigmoid the network was not able to achieve the target model performance. 
* Unable to achieve optimum level of at least 95%.

## Summary

Unofortunately there were drawbacks to neural network algorithms such as overfitting and can create block boxes that are too complex for analysts to understand. Despite running multiple test and changing several variables and factors to still not reach the target percentage would indicate that this method is perhaps not the most efficient solutuion to this problem.
